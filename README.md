# Dating Website Open Source

I am creating a dating website primarily in Python, making it open-source and share the source code on GitHub. This will be built together with Python communities around the world. 

Let's join me if you could contribute idea, skill, experience, business perspective, administrator, facilitator, website users etc.

- Backend: Django (Python)
- Front-end: HTML5 / CSS / Pure JavaScript
