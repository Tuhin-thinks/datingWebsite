# About this project
I am creating a dating website primarily in Python (inevitably later will have JavaScript in the web front-end), making it open-source and share the source code on GitHub. This will be built together with you if you are interested.

Let's join us and contribute your idea, skill, experience, business view, as administrator, as facilitator, as website users etc.

We are using
- Backend: Django version 3.1.6
- Python version 3.8.5
- Front-end: HTML5 / CSS / Pure JavaScript
- Database: sqlite3 (will migrate to PostgreSQL)
